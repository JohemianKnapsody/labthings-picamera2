# labthings-picamera2
A LabThings-FastAPI Thing for working with picamera2

This package defines a `Thing` using [labthings-fastapi] that exposes an HTTP interface to
the Raspberry Pi camera, using `picamera2`. This includes autogenerated OpenAPI documentation
viewed with a built-in Swagger/Redocly page at `/docs/`, and a Web of Things compliant
Thing Description at the camera's root (usually `/camera/`).

## Installation

The package is on PyPI and can be installed using `pip install labthings-picamera2`. Note that
you may need to separately install `pip install labthings-fastapi[server]`. The package
can also be installed from a clone of this repository with `pip install -e .`.

It's usually best to install in a virtual environment, but note that you should use
`python -m venv .venv --system-site-packages` as the `picamera2` package and its 
dependencies are not all installable using `pip`.

## Usage

You can start the server using:

```
labthings-server --json '{"things":{"/camera/":"labthings_picamera2.thing:StreamingPiCamera2"}}'
```
This assumes you have `labthings[server]>=0.0.6` installed.

You may then point a web browser at `http://localhost:5000/camera` or `http://localhost:5000/docs/`.

It's also possible to control it from Python, if you have `labthings-fastapi` installed (note that 
if you're using a separate machine or separate environment for the client,
if you don't add `[server]` it won't install the rather heavy server dependencies like `starlette`.)

To connect, run:

```python
from labthings_fastapi.client import ThingClient
from PIL import Image

cam = ThingClient.from_url("http://localhost:5000/camera/")
blob = cam.capture_jpeg()
image = Image.open(blob.open())
```

All of the properties and actions described in the Thing Description should be present as
Python properties and methods - currently the types and docstrings don't propagate to the
client object, this is planned for the future but isn't reality yet.
